              Mitchell Tenpenny - Mitchell is a multi-faceted entertainer:
              singer, songwriter, producer and performer. Since the release of
              his debut 3X platinum-certified No 1 hit single, “Drunk Me,” he’s
              set new standards for breakout success in country music. He was
              recognized for surpassing the One Billion streams threshold, now
              surpassing 1.5 Billion global streams. Mitchell’s latest album
              This Is The Heavy contains the platinum-selling #1 hit “Truth
              About You,” a song that made chart history with shortest span
              between #1 songs since 1982 with just three weeks since his last
              chart topper. “Truth About You” followed Mitchell’s co-penned #1
              collaboration with labelmate Chris Young on the ACM Music Event
              nominated “At The End Of A Bar.” Mitchell’s current radio single
              “We Got History” is making its way up the charts.

              Morgan Wallen - With over 18.2 billion on-demand streams and eight
              chart-toppers at Country radio, the East Tennessean recently
              became the first artist to have three singles simultaneously in
              the top-10 on country radio with "Last Night," "One Thing At A
              Time" and "Thought You Should Know" – as “Last Night” becomes
              Wallen’s fastest-climbing No. 1 to-date (with just 11 weeks) and
              the fastest-charting No. 1 since 2015, topping breakout hit "You
              Proof" which reached No. 1 after just 14 weeks and remained at No.
              1 on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart for a record-breaking ten
              non-consecutive weeks.

                <p>
                  "Drunk me" is all about heartbreak and getting over someone.
                  Mitchell takes the idea of how alcohol can be a block to help
                  you get over someone.

                  "Some people don't know when to quit and that's why they quit
                  Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem, they
                  can't handle it But that ain't why I started cleanin' up my
                  life Wish it was but, ooh, that would be a lie"

                <p>
                  "Last Night" is all about talking to someone you used to love,
                  saying all you want to say and hoping it won't be the last
                  night you speak to them. The song earned Wallen a No. 1 on
                  Billboard‘s Hot Country Songs chart – one of seven over his
                  career so far.

                <p>
                  "Truth About You" is a damming report of how breakups lead to
                  two sides to the story of what happened. In it Mitchell gives
                  his truth and tells his ex, if she doesn't stop spreading lies
                  about him, he'll tell everyone the truth.

                  one's the truth One of 'em went down and one was made up But
                  in the end we both lose Why can't we meet in the middle Call
                  it even, call a truce If you quit telling lies about me I
                  won't tell the truth about you (truth about you)"
